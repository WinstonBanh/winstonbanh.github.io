# The motivation
When I first started to improve my technical skills with personal projects, I have always want to build a personal website to, first, document what I did and, second, enhance my writing skill. However, this blogging project has been delayed multipled times as I kept telling myself "You don't know html, how can you do it?". Fortunately, I was recently assigned a python scrapping task in which I had to learn html to enough to inspect the competitor's website. This challenge (also opportunity) helped me force myself to learn html, and along the process, I did know enough of html5 to build a simple porfolio website.

# The process
Even for beginners with no previous coding experience, they are still able to build their websites by mimicking the html scripts in the pre-built templates on html5up.net. Along the process, I have learned some basic rules to help you be farmiliar with html. 

## 1. Download Visual Studio Code to work with the html scripts

In order to make this website, I have watched the tutorial video of Alex The Analyst, one of the biggest and most useful data analytics youtuber. His channel helps me a lot in not only learning technical skills but also guiding to the right direction on my self-learning journey.

Moreover, I want to give a big thank to [@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn), who built the website [html5up.net](https://html5up.net). This platform provides many beautiful html5 template where users can re-use them, for free, as the base for their personal websites.
