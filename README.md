# The motivation
When I first started to improve my technical skills with personal projects, I have always want to build a personal website to, first, document what I did and, second, enhance my writing skill. However, this blogging project has been delayed multipled times as I kept telling myself "You don't know html, how can you do it?". Fortunately, I was recently assigned a python scrapping task in which I had to learn html to enough to inspect the competitor's website. This challenge (also opportunity) helped me force myself to learn html, and along the process, I did know enough of html5 to build a simple porfolio website.

**Fun fact**: before deciding to code (or modify the code) a website myself, I did consider to use [Wix.com](wix.com), a user-friendly website building service where you only need to drag-and-drop. Another advantage of Wix is its template collection which is much bigger than html5up.net's. However, on the other hand, you have to pay monthly subscription fee for using its service.
Personally, I did not choose Wix since I did not come this far, as a data analyst, only to come this far.

# The process
Even for beginners with no previous coding experience, they are still able to build their websites by mimicking the html scripts in the pre-built templates on html5up.net. In this blog, I will walk you through how to build website from begin to end. Along the process, I will also share some basic rules (and tricks) to help you to bfarmiliar with html. 

## Material preparation

- **Download the desired template on html5up.net**: Go the the [site](html5up.net), click the "Free download" button on the template that you like. You should check the template demo to see all the pages that template offers.
- **Download Visual Studio Code**: After downloading the template folder, you will usually see a few .htnl files, each representing a page in your website. You will need VSC as the editor to modify those scripts.

## Personalization phase

- **Inspect the page to get the know the elements**: The html script is usually a bit long and quite scary for those who first looks at that. However, unlike most other programming language, for html, you can actually see what part of the script creates which element by using the "Inspect Element" function. 
> Right click on the web page you want to inpsect, and choose "Inspect Element"





# Acknowledgement
In order to make this website, I have watched the tutorial video of Alex The Analyst, one of the biggest and most useful data analytics youtuber. His channel helps me a lot in not only learning technical skills but also guiding to the right direction on my self-learning journey.

Moreover, I want to give a big thank to [@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn), who built the website [html5up.net](https://html5up.net). This platform provides many beautiful html5 template where users can re-use them, for free, as the base for their personal websites.
